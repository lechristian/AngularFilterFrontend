I was given a challenge - for an interview - of filtering through 3 data sets, obtained from a get request, and displaying them to be filtered. This is a replicated my code for the frontend to not break the integrity of the original problem.

I chose to use Angular's powerful filtering and views to create a single page application. With this I was able to complete the challenge in an hour or two.
